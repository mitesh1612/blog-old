# Mitesh Shah's Personal Blog

Hey there, this is my personal blog setup using Gatsby JS with the **Novela** Starter theme which you can find <a href="https://github.com/narative/gatsby-starter-novela" target="_blank"> here</a>.

To add posts to this blog, just add your posts in `content` -> `posts` -> `date` with the appropriate metadata. This repo also has a CI built in it which builds and deploys the blog to http://mitesh1612.github.io/blog
